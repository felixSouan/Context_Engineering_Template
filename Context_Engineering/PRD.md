# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template

## Project Overview
### Project Name
[Insert Project Name]

### Project Description
[Provide a concise overview of the project, including its purpose and key functionality. Specify the target problem or user need it addresses. Note that this PRD is designed for a Context Engineering workflow, enabling an AI (e.g., Cursor, Copilot, or Claude Code) to generate structured documentation like Implementation.md, project_structure.md, and UI_UX_doc.md.]

### Input/Output + Example
[Provide the structure of the input and output of the program. Then, provide one or multiple examples of real input/output.]

### Target Users
[Describe the intended users, their characteristics, and assumptions about their skills or devices (e.g., students with basic tech skills, multi-device users).]

### Business Objectives
[Outline the main goals, e.g., improve efficiency, provide accessibility, keep costs low.]

### Scope
- MVP: [List minimum viable features for initial release.]
- Full App: [List additional features for a complete version.]
- Out of Scope: [Specify exclusions, e.g., no paid services, no mobile app development.]

## Features and Requirements

### Identified Features ----> This can probably be removed, as it is not meant to be in the PRD itself, since the tech stack is not supposed to be defined
[For each feature, include:]
- **Description**: [Briefly explain what the feature does.]
- **User Story**: [e.g., "As a user, I want [action] so that [benefit]."]
- **Technical Notes**: [Mention preferred tools, libraries, or constraints (e.g., Python, free cloud hosting).]
- **Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High to guide AI task breakdown.]

1. [Feature 1 Name]
   - Description: [Detail]
   - User Story: [Story]
   - Technical Notes: [Notes]
   - Complexity: [Level]

2. [Feature 2 Name]
   - Description: [Detail]
   - User Story: [Story]
   - Technical Notes: [Notes]
   - Complexity: [Level]

### Feature Categorization
- **Must-Have Features**: [List]
- **Should-Have Features**: [List]
- **Nice-to-Have Features**: [List]

## Technical Requirements and Constraints
### Recommended Tech Stack Considerations
[Allow AI to research and suggest tech (e.g., Python, free services); List factors like simplicity, cost, scalability, timeline.]

### Integration Requirements
[Specify how components connect, e.g., API endpoints, dependencies.]

### Performance and Scalability
[Define polling frequency, data size, or offline handling needs.]

### Security and Compliance
[Note data sensitivity, ethical considerations, or error handling.]

### Timeline and Resources
- MVP: [Estimated time, e.g., 1-2 days.]
- Full: [Estimated time, e.g., 3-5 days.]
- Team: [e.g., Solo with AI assistance, skill level.]

## Risks and Assumptions
- Risks: [Potential issues and mitigations.]
- Assumptions: [e.g., User has Git, reliable data sources.]

This template is tailored for Context Engineering, providing clear, extractable inputs for AI to generate modular documentation and guide development efficiently. Customize with project-specific details before inputting to an LLM.
